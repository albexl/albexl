### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Software Developer at Volvo Cars.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, Data Structures, Algorithms, and some aspects of Software Development such as REST APIs, Automated Testing, and CI/CD.
- ✍️ I write the [Algorithmically Speaking](https://albexl.hashnode.dev/) blog, where I try to explain some of the previous topics.
