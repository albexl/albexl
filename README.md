# Hi there 👋

My name is Alberto, and I'm a Computer Scientist from the University of Havana.

I have a huge passion for solving problems in the areas of Computer Science and Software Engineering, so don't hesitate to contact me for help on any related subject, especially if they require some complex algorithmic analysis.

I'll be happy to help.

## Current Facts About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Software Developer at Volvo Cars.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.
- 💬 You can ask me about Python, Data Structures, Algorithms, and some aspects of Software Development such as REST APIs, Automated Testing, and CI/CD.

## Education

I love teaching and writing. That's why I try to combine those two passions creating educational content online.

In order to spread knowledge I:

- ✍️ Write the [Algorithmically Speaking](https://albexl.hashnode.dev/) blog.
- 📆 Publish a weekly post about algorithms on my [Substack](https://albexl.substack.com/).
- 🏕️ Collaborate sharing knowledge with [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/albexl).
- 🚗 Collaborate with the [Volvo Cars Engineering](https://medium.com/@albexl) blog.
