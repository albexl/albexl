# Hi there 👋

My name is Alberto, and I'm a Computer Scientist from the University of Havana. I have a huge passion for solving problems in the areas of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

## Current Facts About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Software Developer at Volvo Cars.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.
- 💬 You can ask me about Python, Data Structures, Algorithms, and some aspects of Software Development such as REST APIs, Automated Testing, and CI/CD.

## Education

I love teaching and writing. That's why I combine those two passions creating educational content online.

In order to spread knowledge I:

- ✍️ Write the [Algorithmically Speaking](https://albexl.hashnode.dev/) blog.
- 📆 Publish a weekly post about algorithms on my [Substack](https://albexl.substack.com/).
- 🏕️ Collaborate sharing knowledge with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/albexl).
- 🚗 Collaborate with the [Volvo Cars Engineering](https://medium.com/@albexl) blog.
